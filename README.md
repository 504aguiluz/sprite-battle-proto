# SPRITE CLUB

**VERSION 1.0.0**
Sprite Club is a place where you can battle sprites! One on one, colosseum-style, or build characters and have them auto-fight. The choice is yours. 

# ABOUT THE GAME

A one or two player turn-based battle game that allows you to choose from different classes of sprites and fight it out. 

Either choose to fight, use an ability, or heal on your turn. When a player's hitpoints (HP) gets to zero, that player loses and the round is over.

# SUPER STRETCH GOALS (**version 3.0**)

-to integrate this app with actual DnD-style classes that utilize real mechanics to level up players and allow new spells, abilities, armor, weapons, etc.
-to create a character building page so that players can design their own characters
-to create an auto-battle feature that would allow you to set parameters for battles ahead of time and watch them play out automatically when the battle begins
